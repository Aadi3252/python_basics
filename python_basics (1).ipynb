        "\n",
        "Easy to Learn and Use:\n",
        "Python has a simple and readable syntax that resembles English, making it beginner-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted Language:\n",

        "High-Level Language:\n",
        "Python handles complex tasks like memory management automatically, allowing programmers to focus on logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extensive Standard Library:\n",
        "Python comes with a large collection of built-in modules and functions, supporting tasks like file handling, regular expressions, and web development.\n",
